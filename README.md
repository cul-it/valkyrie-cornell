  files and metadata in Samvera.

## Requirements

### Postgres

Valkyrie requires support for the JSON data type, which was introduced in version 9.4. As a result,
it will only work with versions 9.4 or later.

## Configure Valkyrie

Valkyrie is configured in `config/valkyrie.yml`.  For each environment you must set
two values.  The first, `adapter`, is the store where Valkyrie will put the metadata.
The valid values for `adapter` are `:postgres` (default), `:fedora`(actually ActiveFedora),
`:memory` (should only be used for running tests, because it's not persistent).
You can register your own adapters in `config/initializers/valkyrie.rb`.

Valkyrie will automatically persist to the metadata store you have chosen and write
to Solr synchronously (using the `:indexing_persister`).

The second configuration value `storage_adapter` is where the binaries are stored.
The valid values for `storage_adapter` are `:disk` and `:memory`. `:memory` should
only be used for testing as it's not a persistent store.


## Installing a Development environment

1. Install Postgres on your machine.  If you have homebrew on OS X you can run the following steps:
   1. `brew install postgres`
   1. `brew services start postgresql`
   1. `gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/usr/local/bin/pg_config`
   1. `cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml`
   1.  Edit `config/database.yml` so that the username is the name you use to log into your Mac
1. `bundle install`
1. `rake db:create:all`
1. `rake db:migrate`
1. To run the test suite:
   1. Start Solr and Fedora servers for testing with `rake server:test`
   1. Run the RSpec test suite with `rspec spec`
1. To run the app in development mode for local usage:
   1. Start Solr and Fedora servers for development with `rake server:development`
   1. Bring up a Rails server with `rails s` or a console with `rails c`

### Shared Specs

There are several shared example groups in
[valkyrie/lib/valkyrie/specs/shared_specs](valkyrie/lib/valkyrie/specs/shared_specs), to help verify that all
implementations of the various interfaces are fully-compliant.  You can also use these in your own code to
make sure that any implementations you develop are compliant.

The available example groups are:

* 'a Valkyrie::DerivativeService'
* 'a Valkyrie::FileCharacterizationService'
* 'a Valkyrie::MetadataAdapter'
* 'a Valkyrie::Model'
* 'a Valkyrie::Persister'
* 'a Valkyrie query provider'
* 'a Valkyrie::StorageAdapter'

To use these shared examples, include them in your test file:

```
require 'valkyrie/specs/shared_specs'
```

and then you can use the `it_behaves_like` command to invoke the shared examples:

```
it_behaves_like "a Valkyrie::Model"
```

Example groups typically require that the calling test define a variable, e.g., the 'a Valkyrie::Model' group
requires defining the `model_klass` variable:

```
let(:model_klass) { described_class }
```

The share examples will raise an error if the variables they need aren't defined.
